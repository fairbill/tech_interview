# Professors
  Overview:
  This is an interview Rails project intented to display a list of professors.

# Some of the functionalities you're going to implement in this mini project:

  1. Use one of these free bootstrap templates at your choice: http://bootswatch.com/
  2. A frontpage. The frontpage will have the following items:
    * This page should also have a list/table of professors sorted by their ratings (highest on top). Each professor row in the list/table should have the following columns: first_name, last_name, university_name, rating, and a link to their profile page. Bonus point: Paginate the list/table (Hint: use a plugin such as: https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari).
  
  3. When a user clicks on a name of a professor in the above table, they should be taken to a separate page that contains more details of the professor. The profile page will have the following items:
    * Pofessor's name and rating
    * Professor's university's address display in a small google map.
    * A brieft description for the professor (bio, background, etc.)
    * A photo of the professor (could be just a stub photo)

# Other requirements:
  * Use either MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite to store data. Implement the correct data models and their relationships. Please keep Object Oriented Design in mind.
  
# Note:
  1. Complete as much as you can. I'm looking for code quality and good implementations of Object-Oriented design.
  2. It's okay if you haven't used Rails. I'd highly suggest going through some tutorials such as Rails for Zombies.
